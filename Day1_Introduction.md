# DAY1:  INTRODUCTION TO SYBERSECURITY
#### What is syber security?
- **cyber security is a very wide range of field in the IT world.**
- **It is the practicing of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks**.
- **These syber-attacks are usually aimed at accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive information; extorting money from users via ransomware; or interrupting normal business processes.**
- **Those cyber-attacks sometimes called "Hacking".**
#### What is Hacking?
- **Hacking is referred to exploiting system vulnerabilities and compromising security    controls to gain unauthorized access to the system.**
- **Ethical hacking finds the weak points or loopholes in a computer, web application, or network and reports them to the organization**
- **The person who do the hacking is called “HACKER”.**


### Types of Hacker based on their behavior🧑‍💻
##### 1. Black Hat Hacker
     -> These hackers exploit security weaknesses for personal gain, to steal data, or cause harm. Their activities are illegal and harmful to individuals or organizations.
#### 2. Grey Hat Hacker
     -> They operate in a middle ground, sometimes breaching systems without permission but usually without malicious intent. They may report vulnerabilities but sometimes after unauthorized access.

#### 3. White Hat Hacker
     -> These hackers use their skills legally and ethically to help organizations identify and fix security vulnerabilities. They work to improve cybersecurity and prevent malicious attacks.


### Types of Hackers based on their skills

#### 1. Newbie/ Noob
     -> Don’t have any knowledge about hacking.
#### 2. Script Kiddie
     -> A script kiddie, skiddie, kiddie, or skid is a relatively unskilled individual who uses scripts or programs developed by others, primarily for malicious purposes.

#### 3. Hacker 
    -> Perfectly skilled, with less experience.
#### 4. Elite/Pro Hacker
    -> Perfectly skilled, with more experience.

### Why do we learn hacking?
- **To prevent hackers from gaining access.**
- **To uncover vulnerabilities.**
- **To strengthen the organization.**
- **To safeguard the data.**
- **To avoid security breaches.**
- **To enhance security awareness.**
- **To get job.**

### Why Hack happens?

👉 **ATTACKS = MOTIVE(GOAL) + METHOD + VULNERABILITY**
👉 **MOTIVE:- Information theft, manipulating data, financial loss, revenge, ransom, damaging reputation.**

### Elements of Information Security

##### CIA triad
👉 **The three Letters in "CIA" stand for Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability.**
 👉**The CIA triad is a common model that forms the basis for the development of security systems.**
 👉 **All security measures are based on one or more of these three principles.**

#### 1. Confidentiality (ሚስጥራዊነት)
  👉 **Confidentiality involves the efforts of an organization to make sure data is kept secret or privat**e.
  👉 **To accomplish this, access to information must be controlled to prevent the unauthorized sharing of data—whether intentional or accidental.**
  👉 **For example, those who work with an organization’s finances should be able to access the spreadsheets, bank accounts, and other information related to the flow of money.**
      -> **However, the vast majority of other employees—and perhaps even certain executives—may not be granted access.**
      -> **To ensure these policies are followed, stringent restrictions have to be in place to limit who can see what.**
   👉 **Facebook data breach exposing user info (Example).**
   
#### 2. Integrity (ታማኝነት)
  👉 **Integrity involves making sure your data is trustworthy and free from tampering/Change.**
  👉 **The integrity of your data is maintained only if the data is authentic, accurate, and reliable.**
  👉 **For example, if your company provides information about senior managers on your website, this information needs to have integrity.**
      -> **If it is inaccurate, those visiting the website for information may feel your organization is not trustworthy.**
      -> **Someone with a vested interest in damaging the reputation of your organization may try to hack your website and alter the descriptions, photographs, or titles of the executives to hurt their reputation or that of the company as a whole.**
      -> **Attack on financial transactions to alter records.**
      
#### 3. Availability
   👉 **Availability means information resources (e.g., computer hardware, software, networks, and data) are accessible when you need them.**
   👉 **Even if data is kept confidential and its integrity maintained, it is often useless unless it is available to those in the organization and the customers they serve.**
   👉 **This means that systems, networks, and applications must be functioning as they should and when they should.**
   👉 **For example, there is a power outage and there is no disaster recovery system in place to help users regain access to critical systems, availability will be compromised.**
   👉 **Cyber attacks on a government website causing downtime.**


### Question
1.  **Imagine you’re working at a hospital, and only doctors and authorized staff can view patients' medical records. Which part of the CIA triad is being ensured in this case?**
      **answer: Confidentiality**
2.  **A bank system crashes, and clients cannot access their accounts for several hours. Which aspect of the CIA triad is affected in this scenario?**
     **answer: Availability**
3.  **After a cyberattack, a company discovers that hackers modified financial data in the system. Which part of the CIA triad was compromised?**
     **answer: Integrity**
4. **If a company uses encryption to ensure that even if data is stolen, it cannot be read by unauthorized users, which part of the CIA triad is being applied?**
     **answer: Confidentiality**
5.  **Imagine an online banking system where users can check their account balance and transfer money. What aspect of the CIA triad is being addressed when the bank ensures the data shown to users (like their account balance) is accurate and hasn’t been tampered with?**
